# Moonrocks Control Test

Goal is to warm back up in Unity, while testing a unit control mechanic.
This demo should focus on controls and tech, don't get too into the weeds on fun, just interesting.

* Player directly controls the orb
* orb minmally interacts with world
* orb can control units
    - Either direct control, where player plays as the unit,
    - or planning control, where the player sets the rough AI behavior of the unit.

Should be playable on keyboard/mouse, or controller. Cotnroller preffered.

Bonus mechanic: Give a unit a mind-control ability, that can control other uncontrolled units
